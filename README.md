I encountered the following error in the terminal when running the code in the VS Code editor:

`activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled ...`

I managed to find a solution [here](https://support.enthought.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058403072-Windows-error-activate-ps1-cannot-be-loaded-because-running-scripts-is-disabled-UnauthorizedAccess-). I opted for  *'Option 1 - Select Command Prompt as the default terminal shell in VS Code'*  as it is a quick and straightforward solution.
